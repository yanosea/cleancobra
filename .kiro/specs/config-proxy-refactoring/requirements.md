# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the configuration module to use proxy interfaces instead of direct standard library imports. This improvement will enhance testability by enabling dependency injection and mocking of standard library functions, following the established proxy pattern used throughout the GCT application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the config package to use proxy interfaces for standard library dependencies, so that I can write better unit tests with mocked dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the config package is refactored THEN it SHALL use proxy interfaces instead of direct imports for `os`, `filepath`, and `envconfig` packages
2. WHEN the Load function is called THEN it SHALL use injected proxy dependencies instead of calling standard library functions directly
3. WHEN the configuration validation occurs THEN it SHALL use proxy interfaces for file system operations
4. WHEN default data file path is determined THEN it SHALL use proxy interfaces for environment variable access and path operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the config package to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing code using the config package continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the public API of the config package SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN existing code calls config.Load() THEN it SHALL continue to work exactly as before
3. WHEN the Config struct is used THEN its fields and methods SHALL remain the same
4. WHEN configuration validation is performed THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to the original implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the config package to follow the established proxy pattern, so that it maintains consistency with the rest of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proxy interfaces are used THEN they SHALL be imported from the existing `pkg/proxy` package
2. WHEN dependency injection is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern used in other packages
3. WHEN the config package is structured THEN it SHALL maintain the same file organization and naming conventions
4. WHEN proxy implementations are instantiated THEN they SHALL use the existing `New*()` constructor functions from the proxy package
