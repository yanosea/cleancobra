# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the domain layer (`app/domain`) to use proxy interfaces instead of direct standard library imports. This improvement will enhance testability by enabling dependency injection and mocking of standard library functions, following the established proxy pattern used throughout the GCT application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the domain layer to use proxy interfaces for standard library dependencies, so that I can write better unit tests with mocked dependencies and control time-dependent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain layer is refactored THEN it SHALL use proxy interfaces instead of direct imports for `time`, `strings`, `fmt`, and `json` packages
2. WHEN Todo entity operations are performed THEN they SHALL use injected proxy dependencies instead of calling standard library functions directly
3. WHEN time-dependent operations occur THEN they SHALL use proxy interfaces to enable consistent testing
4. WHEN JSON marshaling/unmarshaling is performed THEN it SHALL use proxy interfaces to enable error simulation testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the domain layer to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing code using the domain entities continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the public API of domain entities SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN existing code creates Todo entities THEN it SHALL continue to work exactly as before
3. WHEN domain entity methods are called THEN their behavior SHALL be identical to the original implementation
4. WHEN domain errors are used THEN their functionality SHALL remain the same

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the domain layer to follow the established proxy pattern, so that it maintains consistency with the rest of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proxy interfaces are used THEN they SHALL be imported from the existing `pkg/proxy` package
2. WHEN dependency injection is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern used in other packages
3. WHEN the domain layer is structured THEN it SHALL maintain the same file organization and naming conventions
4. WHEN proxy implementations are instantiated THEN they SHALL use the existing `New*()` constructor functions from the proxy package

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced testing capabilities for domain entities, so that I can write more reliable and comprehensive tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing time-dependent functionality THEN tests SHALL be able to control time through proxy interfaces
2. WHEN testing JSON operations THEN tests SHALL be able to simulate marshaling/unmarshaling errors
3. WHEN testing string operations THEN tests SHALL be able to control string manipulation behavior
4. WHEN testing error formatting THEN tests SHALL be able to verify exact error message formatting
